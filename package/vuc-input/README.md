### Tip

- In order to be compatible with some special effects, some effects of input input box are removed. 
- In the case of focus acquisition, the focus position cannot be switched with the mouse, because the canvas level is higher than the input level in the case of focus acquisition. 
- There are differences between IE and WebKit kernel
